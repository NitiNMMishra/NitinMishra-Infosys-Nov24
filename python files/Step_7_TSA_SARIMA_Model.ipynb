    "# SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMA extends the ARIMA model by incorporating seasonal components, making it suitable for time series data with repeating patterns over regular intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or yearly). The SARIMA model combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autoregression (AR)**: Captures relationships between the current observation and past observations (lags).\n",
    "- **Differencing (I)**: Removes trends or seasonality to make the series stationary.\n",
    "- **Moving Average (MA)**: Models the relationship between the observation and the residual errors from previous lags.\n",
    "- **Seasonal Components (SAR, SI, SMA)**: Accounts for repeating patterns or seasonality at specific intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the dataset to identify seasonality and trends.\n",
    "- **Stationarity Testing**: Using the Dickey-Fuller test to ensure the series is stationary.\n",
    "- **Seasonal Component Identification**: Recognizing the seasonal frequency and adjusting parameters accordingly.\n",
    "- **Model Fitting**: Applying the SARIMA model to capture both trend and seasonal variations.\n",
    "- **Forecasting**: Generating future predictions while considering seasonality.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Validating the model's performance by comparing predicted values with actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on accurately modeling time series data with strong seasonal behavior and leveraging these patterns for reliable forecasting.\n"

    "# Steps 3 to 9: Performing SARIMA Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I analyzed each time series column, applied the SARIMA model, and forecasted future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Iterating Over Time Series Columns\n",
    "- I looped through each column (`Clicks`, `Impressions`, `Quantity`) to perform the SARIMA analysis individually.\n",
    "- For each column:\n",
    "  - Missing values were removed using `.dropna()` to ensure the data was clean.\n",
    "  - I displayed the first 5 rows of the column to inspect the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Visualizing the Time Series\n",
    "- I plotted the time series for each column to understand trends, seasonality, and potential anomalies.\n",
    "- The x-axis represents `Day Index`, and the y-axis represents the column's values.\n",
    "- This visualization provided a clear understanding of the data’s behavior over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Testing for Stationarity\n",
    "- I used the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test** to check whether the time series was stationary:\n",
    "  - If the `p-value` was greater than 0.05, the data was non-stationary, so I applied **differencing** to make it stationary.\n",
    "  - For stationary data, no adjustments were needed.\n",
    "- The transformed data was displayed to verify the stationarity process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Fitting the SARIMA Model\n",
    "- I applied the SARIMA model with the following parameters:\n",
    "  - `(p, d, q)` for non-seasonal components set to `(1, 1, 1)`.\n",
    "  - `(P, D, Q, s)` for seasonal components set to `(1, 1, 1, 12)` to capture monthly seasonality.\n",
    "- The model was trained using the `.fit()` method, and the summary was printed to understand the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Making Predictions\n",
    "- Using the fitted SARIMA model, I predicted values for the observed time points:\n",
    "  - Predictions were made using `.predict()`.\n",
    "  - I compared the **Actual** vs. **Predicted** values by creating a DataFrame and displaying the first 5 rows.\n",
    "  - A plot was generated to visualize the comparison, with the actual data shown in blue and predictions in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Forecasting Future Values\n",
    "- I forecasted the next 5 values for each time series using the `.forecast()` method.\n",
    "- The forecast results provided insights into the expected behavior of the data for future time points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Visualizing Forecast Results\n",
    "- I plotted the forecasted values alongside the original time series to observe how well the model captured the data’s seasonal patterns:\n",
    "  - The original data was plotted in blue, and the forecasted values were plotted in red.\n",
    "- This visualization helped validate the model’s ability to forecast seasonal trends."
