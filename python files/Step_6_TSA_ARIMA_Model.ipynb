    "# ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series analysis and forecasting. The ARIMA model combines three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autoregression (AR)**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations.\n",
    "- **Differencing (I)**: Makes the time series stationary by removing trends and seasonality.\n",
    "- **Moving Average (MA)**: Models the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the dataset for analysis.\n",
    "- **Stationarity Testing**: Using the Dickey-Fuller test to check if the time series is stationary.\n",
    "- **Model Fitting**: Applying the ARIMA model to capture both trend and noise in the data.\n",
    "- **Forecasting**: Using the model to predict future values.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Comparing the predicted values with the actual data to assess model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus is on combining these three components effectively to model the time series data and forecast future values accurately."

    "  - **Impressions**: Represents the number of impressions generated over time.\n",
    "  - **Quantity**: Represents the quantity values over time, which is the primary target variable for forecasting.\n",
    "- These columns were stored in a list called `time_series_columns` to enable easy iteration and analysis in subsequent steps.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this section, I analyzed each time series column, applied the ARIMA model, and forecasted future values step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Looping Through Each Column\n",
    "- I iterated over the columns `Clicks`, `Impressions`, and `Quantity` to analyze them individually.\n",
    "- For each column:\n",
    "  - I removed missing values using `.dropna()` to ensure the data was clean and ready for analysis.\n",
    "  - I printed the first 5 rows of the column to get a quick look at its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Visualizing the Time Series\n",
    "- I plotted the time series data for each column to observe its trends, patterns, and any seasonality.\n",
    "- The x-axis represents the `Day Index` (time), while the y-axis represents the column's values.\n",
    "- This helped me understand how the data behaves over time and what challenges the model might face.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Testing for Stationarity\n",
    "- I used the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test** to check if the time series was stationary:\n",
    "  - If the `p-value` was greater than 0.05, the data was non-stationary, so I applied **differencing** to remove trends and make it stationary.\n",
    "  - If the `p-value` was less than or equal to 0.05, the data was already stationary, so no adjustments were needed.\n",
    "- For non-stationary data, I computed the differenced series using `.diff()` and printed the first 5 rows to confirm the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Fitting the ARIMA Model\n",
    "- I applied the ARIMA model to the stationary time series:\n",
    "  - The model parameters `(p, d, q)` were set to `(1, 1, 1)` for this analysis. These values can be adjusted based on the dataset's behavior.\n",
    "  - I trained the model using the `.fit()` method and printed the model summary to understand its performance and coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Making Predictions\n",
    "- I used the trained ARIMA model to predict values within the dataset:\n",
    "  - Predictions were made using the `.predict()` method for all time points, except for the initial lag.\n",
    "  - I compared the **Actual** and **Predicted** values by combining them into a `pandas` DataFrame.\n",
    "  - I displayed the first 5 rows of the comparison to review the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Forecasting Future Values\n",
    "- I used the ARIMA model to forecast the next 5 values for each column:\n",
    "  - The `.forecast()` method provided predictions for future time points based on historical patterns.\n",
    "  - These forecasts gave me an idea of how the time series might behave in the near future.\n",
    "  - I printed the forecasted values for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Visualizing the Forecast\n",
    "- I plotted the original time series alongside the forecasted values to compare them visually:\n",
    "  - The original series was shown in blue, while the forecasted values were highlighted in red.\n",
    "  - This visualization made it easy to evaluate how well the model predicts future trends."
